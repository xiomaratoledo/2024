`FileInputStream` and `BufferedReader` serve different purposes when it comes to file I/O in Java.

### FileInputStream:

1. **Purpose:**
   - `FileInputStream` is primarily used for reading raw binary data from a file, such as images, audio files, or any other non-text data.

2. **Byte Reading:**
   - It reads data in the form of bytes. The `read()` method of `FileInputStream` returns the next byte of data from the file.

3. **No Buffering:**
   - `FileInputStream` does not provide buffering by default. It reads one byte at a time, which can be less efficient for reading large amounts of data.

### BufferedReader:

1. **Purpose:**
   - `BufferedReader` is specifically designed for reading character-based data from a file. It's more suitable for reading text files.

2. **Character Reading:**
   - It reads data in the form of characters. The `readLine()` method reads a line of text, and `read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)` can be used for reading characters into a buffer.

3. **Buffering:**
   - `BufferedReader` provides buffering, which means it reads data in larger chunks, improving the efficiency of I/O operations. This is particularly useful when dealing with large text files.

### Choosing Between Them:

- **Binary Data:**
  - Use `FileInputStream` when dealing with raw binary data, where you need to read bytes directly.

- **Text Data:**
  - Use `BufferedReader` when working with text files or when you need to process text line by line. It provides convenient methods for reading text and buffering for improved performance.

### Example Comparison:

**FileInputStream:**

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileInputStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";

        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileName)) {
            int data;
            while ((data = fis.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**BufferedReader:**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fileName = "example.txt";

        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In summary, use `FileInputStream` for raw binary data, and use `BufferedReader` for efficient reading of character-based data, especially when dealing with text files.
