To familiarize yourself with the differences between `FileInputStream` and `BufferedReader`, it's important to understand their primary purposes, typical use cases, and how they handle input differently. Here's what you should remember:

1. **Purpose**:
   - `FileInputStream`: Used for reading raw bytes from a file.
   - `BufferedReader`: Used for reading text from a character-input stream, typically used for reading lines of text efficiently.

2. **Level of Abstraction**:
   - `FileInputStream` operates at a lower level, dealing with raw bytes.
   - `BufferedReader` operates at a higher level, providing methods for reading text lines and handling character encoding.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - `FileInputStream` is more efficient for reading large amounts of raw binary data, such as images or serialized objects.
   - `BufferedReader` is more efficient for reading text files line by line, especially when dealing with large text files, as it buffers the input for better performance.

4. **Usage**:
   - Use `FileInputStream` when you need to read raw binary data or when you want more control over reading individual bytes from a file.
   - Use `BufferedReader` when you're reading text files and want to read lines of text efficiently, handling character encoding and buffering automatically.

5. **Handling Text**:
   - When using `FileInputStream`, you need to handle text encoding yourself if you're dealing with text files.
   - `BufferedReader` handles text encoding automatically based on the platform's default charset or a specified charset, making it easier to work with text files.

6. **Convenience**:
   - `BufferedReader` provides convenient methods like `readLine()` for reading lines of text, which is often what you want when dealing with text files.
   - `FileInputStream` provides lower-level methods for reading bytes, which gives you more flexibility but requires more effort to handle text parsing.

By understanding these points and practicing with both classes, you'll become familiar with their differences and know when to use each one effectively in your Java programs.
