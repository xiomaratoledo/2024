Yes, that's correct! I apologize for any confusion. The sequence of calculations you've shown is indeed the correct way to understand how the recursive calls unfold and how the multiplication is performed. Let's break it down:

```
calculateFactorial(4) = 4 * calculateFactorial(3)
                       = 4 * (3 * calculateFactorial(2))
                       = 4 * (3 * (2 * calculateFactorial(1)))
                       = 4 * (3 * (2 * 1))
                       = 4 * (3 * 2)
                       = 4 * 6
                       = 24
```

This breakdown illustrates how each recursive call contributes to the multiplication sequence, ultimately leading to the factorial of 4. Each recursive call is resolved before moving to the next step in the sequence. Thank you for clarifying!
