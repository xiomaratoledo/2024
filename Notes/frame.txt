Why use JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE instead of frame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE


The reason you use `JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE` instead of `frame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE` is because `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` is a static constant of the `JFrame` class itself, not an instance variable. 

When you set the default close operation for a `JFrame`, you're essentially telling the program what to do when the user closes the window. `JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE` is a constant that tells the frame to exit the entire application when it's closed. This means that when the user closes the JFrame window, it will not only close the window but also terminate the entire Java application.

If you were to use `frame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE`, you would be trying to access a static constant from an instance variable, which is not possible. The correct way to access `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` is by referencing it through the class name `JFrame`.

Here's an example of how it should be used:

```java
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
```

This sets the default close operation of the `frame` object to `EXIT_ON_CLOSE`, ensuring that the application terminates when the frame is closed.




Apologies for any confusion. To clarify:

In Java, you can access static members (such as static constants, static variables, and static methods) through an instance variable, but it's generally recommended to access them directly through the class name for clarity and to avoid confusion.

So, while accessing `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` through an instance variable like `frame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE` might compile and work due to Java's leniency, it's not a recommended practice because it can be misleading. Static members belong to the class itself, not to instances of the class, so accessing them through an instance variable might confuse other developers who read your code.

Therefore, it's best to access static constants like `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` directly through the class name, as in `JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE`, to make it clear that it's a static member of the `JFrame` class. This promotes readability and helps prevent potential misunderstandings.
