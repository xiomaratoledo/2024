Hey I have a question about why there is no break statement in case 4? Can you explain it please? Thanks

Certainly! In Java, when a `break` statement is encountered within a `switch` statement, it exits the `switch` block. However, in the case of your program, the `break` statement is not strictly necessary after case 4. The reason is that after the `System.exit(0)` statement is executed, the program terminates, and control does not return to the `switch` statement.

When `System.exit(0)` is called, it immediately terminates the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with the status code 0. In other words, it forcefully ends the execution of the entire program. Once this happens, there's no need for an additional `break` statement because the program will not continue executing code beyond that point.

Here's a breakdown of what happens:

1. The user selects option 4 in the menu.
2. `System.exit(0)` is called, and the program terminates immediately.
3. Since the program has terminated, control does not return to the `switch` statement.

In this specific case, you could include a `break` statement after `System.exit(0)`, but it won't have any practical effect because the program has already exited. It's generally good practice to include a `break` after each case in a `switch` statement to make the code more readable and to avoid unintentional fall-through, but in this particular scenario, it's not strictly necessary due to the use of `System.exit(0)`.

so System.exit(0) is to end the whole program. While the break only end the loop. is that  correct?

Yes, that's correct! Let's clarify the roles of `System.exit(0)` and `break`:

1. **`System.exit(0)`:** This statement is used to terminate the entire Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It takes an exit status code (in this case, 0) as an argument. When `System.exit(0)` is executed, it forcefully ends the program, and control is returned to the operating system. The value 0 typically indicates a successful execution, while non-zero values may indicate an error or abnormal termination.

2. **`break`:** In the context of a `switch` statement or a loop, the `break` statement is used to exit the immediate enclosing block. In a `switch` statement, it is used to exit the `switch` block. In a loop, it is used to exit the loop. Without a `break` statement, control would "fall through" to the next case or iteration.

In the specific case of your menu-driven program:

- When the user selects option 4, `System.exit(0)` is called, and the entire program is terminated. At this point, control does not return to the `switch` statement or any other part of the program.

- If you were using `break` after `System.exit(0)`, it would technically end the `switch` block, but since the program is exiting immediately, the `break` statement wouldn't have any practical impact.

So, in summary, `System.exit(0)` terminates the entire program, and `break` is used to exit the immediate control structure (such as a `switch` block or a loop).
